Information Editor and Vendor Addresses

An information editor/viewer that tracks information about machinery and tools using a tabbed interface. One tab has the machinery/tool information using a treeview. The other tab uses a listview to keep names and addresses of all vendors in a seperate view. This is written in Javafx using the Netbeans IDE. I am using a Sqlite database to store all information.

This is still in an alpha state and some features don't work correctly yet.
