Information Editor and Vendor Addresses

An information editor/viewer that tracks information about machinery and tools I use at work. I am using a Sqlite database to store all information. Also I keep names and addresses of all my vendors in a seperate tabbed view written using Javafx and the Netbeans IDE.

This is still in an alpha state and some features don't work correctly yet. You have been warned!
